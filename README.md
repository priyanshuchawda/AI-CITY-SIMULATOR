# AI-Powered Virtual City Simulator

## Overview
The AI-Powered Virtual City Simulator is designed to simulate various aspects of city life, including infrastructure, economy, and user behavior. It leverages multiple services such as AI predictions, economic simulations, and real-time city management, ensuring smooth virtual operations.

## Environment Setup
To run this project, you need to configure the necessary environment variables for each service. Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to each service directory:**
   - `ai-city-simulator-backend/services/city-service`
   - `ai-city-simulator-backend/services/ai-service`
   - `ai-city-simulator-backend/services/economy-service`
   - `ai-city-simulator-backend/services/user-service`

2. **Create a `.env` file in each directory** based on the `.env.example` file provided.

3. **Fill in the actual values for each environment variable** in the `.env` files:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
   POSTGRESQL_URI=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
   NEO4J_URI=bolt://host:port
   NEO4J_USER=your_neo4j_username
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password
   ```
   Replace the placeholders (`username`, `password`, `host`, `port`) with your actual database credentials and connection details.

4. **Ensure the `.env` files are added to `.gitignore`** to prevent sensitive information from being committed.

## Available Scripts
